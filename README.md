### Site is a work in progress

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) mirror of [www.meshinfrasoft.com](http://www.meshinfrasoft.com/). Click [here](https://mesh-infrasoft.github.io) or the title to visit. The goal is to port it to the [GoHugo](https://gohugo.io/) static website framework for ease of updating, testing and content creation.

We will be starting with [Hugo blank theme](https://github.com/Vimux/blank) or [Hugo plain theme](https://github.com/hiAndrewQuinn/hugo-plain-theme) to display plain HTML and developing from there to replicate the parent site theme before improving, following [guides](https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2022/07/really-getting-started-hugo/),  [documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/), [forums](https://discourse.gohugo.io/) and personal experience with other Hugo themes.

We will also optimise the current Chromium Lighthouse score (mainly too-large images and Google Maps being auto-loaded):
